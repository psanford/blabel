blabel (1.03-28) buster; urgency=low

  * Debian package now depends on libgtk-3-0 (>= 3.20.0), as the Glade UI we use
    won't load correctly for older versions.
  * "Clear text and style" now defaults to system's default font instead of hardcoded
    Sans 12 as it doens't seem to be available in all systems.
  * Implemented "Clear text and restore saved style" which does exactly what it
    says on the tin.
