Using:

Switch the printer to 'extended' mode (flip the switch at the back to
'E'), connect it to your box and turn the printer on. Add to CUPS as an
ASCII-printer (the printer driver should say "Generic text-only
printer"), while the port is "usb://Brother/PT-1230PC" or similar.

After that run B-label (it should appear under 'Graphics' section in
your system menus), select the printer you just added and print away!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program is not even near completition, but I decided to release it as it's
perfectly capable of handling most every day use cases for the printer.

When looking at the code, please bear in mind that I'm not a programmer, and
this was the first GTK-Glade program I've ever done. I'll eventually clean it up
more and probably remove the GD depency aswell.

For any feedback, you can mail me at ari@sovijarvi.fi, or contact me via
IRC on EFNet, IRCnet or Freenode (my nick is 'APz').

Have fun!
