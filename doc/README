Before using this program you need to add your printer in CUPS.

Switch the printer to "extended" mode (flip the switch at the back to
"E"), connect it to your computer and turn the printer on. Add to CUPS as
an an ASCII-printer (the printer driver should say "Generic text-only
printer"), while the port is "usb://Brother/PT-1230PC" or similar.

After that run B-Label (it should appear under "Graphics" section in
your system menus), select the printer you just added and print away!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To-do things:

- User configurable margins
- Print multiple copies with autocut
- More graphics, perhaps one at the beginning and other at the end?
- Test more models? PT-2320PC? Hand held devices with USB interface?
- RPM package

For any feedback, you can mail me at ari@sovijarvi.fi.

Happy labeling!
